        <h1 class="title-1">About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome! My name is Papy Olenga, and I am a User Experience and Web Developer professional. A few years ago, while exploring a career change from health sciences, I discovered my passion for web development. Always fascinated by computers, I started with a free Python programming class, which sparked my interest and led me to pursue a career in this exciting field.
        </p>
        <p>I am currently working toward a bachelor's degree in Web and User Experience, with a focus on full-stack web development, at Weber State University. Rather than taking the self-taught route, I chose a formal education to gain a deeper understanding of user experience, research, accessibility, and disability rights—key principles that shape my approach to web development.</p>
        <p>Outside of coding, I cherish spending time with family and friends. I am also a chess player and a drone enthusiast who enjoys recording aerial videos during outdoor adventures. Soon, I plan to launch a YouTube channel to share my passion for capturing stunning aerial footage.</p>

          <h1 class="title-1">When I Hear "Accessibility"</h1>
   <p>I believe websites must welcome everyone to provide equal access to online services and information. Disabilities affect 16% <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health" target="_blank">[1]</a> of the world’s population and 26% <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/disability-and-health/articles-documents/disability-impacts-all-of-us-infographic.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a>  of the U.S. population, representing millions of people that are left out when the internet is not inclusive. A responsible business cannot ingore such a large number of customers. Businesses grow by reaching a larger audience, driving engagement, increasing sales, and improving customer satisfaction. Accessibility boosts a company’s reputation, elevates rankings in online search, and ensures compliance with disability and accessibility laws. I am dedicated to following accessibility guidelines to empower all users.</p>

        <h1 class="title-1">Automated Tools are Not Enough</h1>
        <p>
        Testing accessibility with only automated tools like WebAIM's WAVE tool is not enough. They cannot assess whether alt text is meaningful or determine if an image is purely decorative and requires empty alt text. These tools also fail to verify if video captions exist or if they are helpful for deaf users. They struggle to evaluate content structure, such as deciding when to use tables, text blocks, or ordered lists, as they lack the contextual understanding that humans possess. While automated tools can flag insufficient color contrast, they face challenges with semi-transparent or gradient backgrounds. They can identify if elements are focusable and if focus is visible but cannot ensure that an entire website is fully usable with a keyboard. Overall, they are useful for some tasks but cannot replace human judgment in creating truly accessible websites.</p>
        <p>I believe Web accessibility does not happen by accident. It requires deliberate effort and a firm commitment to adhering to the universal standards outlined in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).</p>

          <li>Commit to continual learning about trends in accessible design.</li>
          <li>Employ formal accessibility quality assurance methods.</li>
