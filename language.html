      <p>
        <strong>Plain language</strong> is a style of writing that prioritizes
        clarity and simplicity, making information easy to understand for a
        broad audience. It involves using straightforward vocabulary, concise
        sentences, and a logical structure to ensure that the intended message
        is communicated effectively without unnecessary complexity. By adopting
        plain language principles, writers can ensure their messages are
        inclusive, effective, and impactful.

        <h2 class="title-2">Why does plain language matter?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <u><em>Accessibility</em></u
            >: Plain language makes information accessible to everyone,
            including those with varying levels of literacy, non-native
            speakers, and individuals with cognitive disabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u><em>Efficiency</em></u
            >: Clear communication reduces misunderstandings and the need for
            follow-up questions, saving time for both the writer and the reader.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u><em>Engagement</em></u
            >: When information is easy to understand, readers are more likely
            to stay engaged and retain the information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u><em>Trust</em></u
            >: Transparent and straightforward communication builds trust
            between the writer and the audience, whether in business,
            government, or everyday interactions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By adopting plain language principles, writers can ensure their
          messages are inclusive, effective, and impactful.

      <h2 class="title-2">Plain Language Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The plain language guidelines aim to make written communication more
        accessible and understandable. They emphasize knowing your audience and
        tailoring content to their needs. Key strategies include organizing text
        to highlight main points first, using headings and lists to break up
        dense information, and avoiding technical jargon and complex sentences.
        Active voice is preferred for clarity, and consistency in style and
        terminology is crucial. While these guidelines are essential for clear
        communication, occasional deviations may occur as writers address the
        complexities of language.

        <h3>Original paragraph</h3>
        <p>
          The environmental impacts of urbanization have been significant,
          particularly concerning the increase in air pollution levels and the
          reduction in green spaces due to the expansion of infrastructure.
          Cities have been experiencing a rise in air pollutants resulting from
          increased vehicular emissions and industrial activities. This has been
          exacerbated by the reduction in natural environments, which has
          decreased the capacity for city landscapes to filter out pollution
          naturally. Noise pollution has also become predominant, with the
          increasing population density leading to a surge in transportation
          noise and general urban activity. These environmental challenges have
          prompted cities to adopt various measures aimed at mitigating their
          impacts, such as the implementation of green roofs and the creation of
          urban parks. Moreover, public transportation systems have been
          expanded and improved to reduce reliance on personal vehicles. Efforts
          to promote sustainable practices are continuing, as are initiatives to
          enhance urban resilience in the face of environmental challenges.

        <p>
          Urbanization has significantly impacted the environment, particularly
          through increased air pollution and reduced green spaces. Vehicle
          emissions and industrial activities, combined with the loss of natural
          environments that filter pollution, caused a rise in air pollutants in
          cities. Higher population densities also lead to more transportation
          noise and urban activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          To reduce these environmental challenges, cities adopted measures like
          green roofs and urban parks, expanded and improved public
          transportation. Cities continue to promote sustainable practices and
          initiatives to improve urban resilience.

      <h2 class="title-2">Part 2. Summary of Plain Language</h2>
      <p>
        Plain language guidelines help make written communication clear and easy
        to understand. They offer strategies to ensure readers can easily grasp
        the message. A key principle for effective communication is knowing your
        audience and tailoring the content to their needs, expectations, and
        knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Organize your text clearly by starting with the most important topics.
        This makes the main message easy to understand and reduces the reader's
        effort. Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists to
        break up dense paragraphs into smaller, easier-to-read sections that
        help readers understand and remember the information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The guidelines encourage using clear, simple language and avoiding
        technical jargon, complex terms, or complicated sentence structures.
        However, sometimes complex language may accidentally appear in writing,
        making it harder to follow these guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Active voice makes sentences clear and direct, though passive voice
        might appear occasionally and reduce clarity. Consistency in style and
        terms is also important to keep the document clear and avoid confusion.
        In conclusion, plain language guidelines help writers communicate
        clearly and effectively. While following these principles is the rule,
        some exceptions may happen as writers work to find the best way to share
        their ideas and information.
      </p>

      <h2 class="title-2">Part 3. Verbs Demystified</h2>
      <p>
        Active sentences make the subject perform the action of the verb, which
        makes the sentence clear and direct. To change passive to active voice,
        make the subject the doer of the action. For example, 'The mouse was
        chased by the cat' (passive) becomes 'The cat chased the mouse'
        (active). Passive sentences often include forms of 'to be' (like is,
        was) and a past participle. If the doer isn’t important, it may be left
        out, like 'The report was completed.' To make it active, say 'The team
        completed the report.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Active voice makes sentences more engaging and clearer, especially in
        instructions, persuasion, or informative writing. English verbs come in
        various tenses, each showing different meanings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Simple tenses, like: present ('walk'), past ('walked'), and future
        ('will walk'), are easy to read and show habits, facts, or actions at
        different times. For example, 'She walks to school every day' (present),
        'She walked to school yesterday' (past), and 'She will walk to school
        tomorrow' (future).
      </p>
      <p>
        Continuous tenses, like: present ('is walking'), past ('was walking'),
        and future ('will be walking') describe ongoing actions but can add
        complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perfect tenses, like present ('has walked'), past ('had walked'), and
        future ('will have walked') are more advanced and often link actions to
        specific times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perfect and continuous verb forms (e.g., 'has been walking') can make
        writing less clear unless needed for a specific context. Simple verb
        forms are better for clear, accessible writing, especially for a wide
        audience. They keep sentences concise and easier to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Complex verb forms can show detailed time frames or ongoing actions, but
        they’re often unnecessary in simple communication. Use active voice and
        simple verbs to make your writing clear, engaging, and effective.
